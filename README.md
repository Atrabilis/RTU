## Overview

The RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) Project is designed to facilitate the understanding and implementation of SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) protocols, particularly focusing on IEC 60870-5-104. This repository contains various resources and code examples for analyzing and simulating SCADA communication.

- `COT_values.csv`: Lists the Cause of Transmission values.
- `Information_objects.csv`: Details the information object types.
- `TR-IEC104.pdf`: A technical reference for the IEC 104 protocol.
- `analizar_trafico.py`: A Python script for traffic analysis.
- `client.py`: A basic IEC 104 client implementation.
- `funciones.py`: Utility functions for handling IEC 104 frames.
- `iec104_control_frames.py`: Definitions and utilities for IEC 104 control frames.
